Binary Tree
it is hierarical data structure with different types of node parent, child and leaves
a tree whose element has atmost 2 children
appliation- file system in computer

SEARCH
LL<BT<<ARR

INSERTION/DELETION
quicker than array and slow than unordered LL


PROPERTIES

1. max no of nodes in level l=2^(l-1)-1
2. max of nodes of height h=2^(h-1)-1
    height means from root to deepest leave
3. n nodes
    level=logN+1(atleast)
4 Leaf Node=Internal Node+1    



TYPES

1. FULL BINARY TREE:
    tree with 0/2 children
    Leaf_node=Internal_Node+1
    
               18
            /     \  
          40       30  
                   /  \
                 100   40
    
2. COMPLETE BINARY TREE
    all levels are completely filled with left node is partially filled
                     18
                    /  \      
                   30   20
                  /  
                100   

3. PERFECT BINARY TREE
    all internal nodes are having 2 children with same level 
    
              18
            /     \  
          40       30

4. DEGENERATE TREE
    internal node having single node

ENUMERATION OF BINARY TREE
  
  BT with labeled node or unabled nodes
  Number of Labeled Tees = (Number of unlabeled trees) * n!
